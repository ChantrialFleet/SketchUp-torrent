+  SketchUp Make's interface is uncluttered and straightforward, allowing you to focus on your design. Easily drag and drop shapes from the toolbar into a workspace. Then, edit the shapes with precision tools, including pencils, line weights, colors, and more

+  However, SketchUp Make is a different tool from most design software. For starters, the navigation and drawing tools are on opposite sides of the toolbar instead of sharing space as they do with alternative packages

+  SketchUp also has a vast array of 3D models from which you can download and customize everything from fences to refrigerators

+  The 3DWarehouse is a great resource for finding quality components and fittings, but it can become time-consuming

+  Uniquely, there are extra helpful tools included in layers, allowing you to view all objects separately. This makes it so that it's easy to access and control visibility without affecting other elements

**SketchUp uses only one installer for all available languages. The installer will download using your selected language at the time of installation**
